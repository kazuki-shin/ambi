# Ambi Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Ambi web-based proof of concept (POC) based on the product requirements document (prd.md). This plan can be used to create tickets and track progress during implementation.

## Overview

The new Ambi approach focuses on creating a web-based proof of concept that leverages ElevenLabs Conversational AI to provide an emotionally intelligent companion for elderly users. The implementation will be deployed on Fly.io and emphasizes natural conversations with minimal latency, proactive engagement based on emotional states, and a simple, accessible interface.
