# Agent Session Initialization: Documentation and Codebase Analysis Protocol

## Critical Rules

- At the start of each new agent session, automatically access and parse all files within the `docs/` directory.
- Prioritize analysis of Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and Implementation Plans found in `docs/`.
- Perform static analysis of the current codebase to understand its structure and implemented features.
- Correlate information from documentation (requirements, planned features) with the actual state of the codebase.
- Identify and list:
  - Implemented features.
  - Pending features from documentation.
  - Discrepancies or gaps between documentation and codebase.
- Determine logical next development steps based on this analysis.
- Synthesize findings into an initial actionable summary for the user, including:
  - Priority tasks.
  - Potential technical challenges.
  - Recommended implementation approaches, considering existing codebase patterns.
- This entire process must complete before engaging in the first interaction with the user in the new session.

## Examples

<example>
  Agent (on new session): "Hello! I've analyzed the project documentation in `docs/` and the current codebase.
  Current Status:
  - Phase 1.3 (Frontend Foundation) appears complete.
  - PRD specifies X, Y, Z features for Phase 2.
  Identified Gaps:
  - Feature X (Emotion Detection - Voice Analysis) from Week 4 is not yet implemented.
  Next Steps:
  - Recommend starting with `docs/implementation-plan.md` task 4.1: Integrate voice emotion detection API.
  - Potential challenge: Selecting a suitable voice emotion detection API compatible with ElevenLabs.
  How can I assist you with this?"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Agent (on new session): "Hello! How can I help you today?"
  (Agent has not performed any pre-analysis of docs or code and is waiting for user direction without initial context.)
