# First Principles Thinking Strategy

## Critical Rules

- **Identify Problem:** State the core problem clearly in a single sentence.
- **Reject Assumptions:** List 3-5 common assumptions related to the problem and explicitly state you are discarding them for this process.
- **Decompose:** Break the problem down into its most fundamental, irreducible elements or truths. What are the absolute basics involved?
- **Question Deeply:** For any proposed solution or significant element, ask "Why?" five times consecutively, drilling down to underlying reasons.
- **Recombine:** Generate at least 3 novel approaches by combining the fundamental elements in new ways.
- **Evaluate Fundamentally:** Assess each new combination based *only* on fundamental laws (physics, math, logic, core system constraints) and *not* on precedent, best practices, or how things are usually done.
- **Iterate:** Select the most promising combination and refine it by repeating the decomposition, recombination, and fundamental evaluation steps.
- **Finalize:** Articulate the chosen solution in terms of the fundamental principles discovered, avoiding jargon or reliance on established frameworks.
- Maintain clarity and precision throughout; avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Examples

<example>
  **Scenario:** Designing a novel user authentication system.
  **Agent applies the rule:**
  1.  **Problem:** Securely verify a user's identity for system access.
  2.  **Assumptions Rejected:** Discard assumptions like "must use passwords," "needs email verification," "requires OAuth."
  3.  **Decompose:** Fundamental elements: User has unique attribute(s), system needs proof attribute belongs to user presenting it, proof must be hard to forge/replay, verification process must be fast enough.
  4.  **Question Deeply (Example Step):** *Why* does the system need proof? To prevent unauthorized access. *Why* prevent unauthorized access? To protect user data/system integrity... (continues 3 more times).
  5.  **Recombine:** (1) User presents biometric + time-locked token generated by a trusted device. (2) User answers dynamic security questions based on securely pre-shared secrets. (3) User performs a unique physical action verifiable by device sensors.
  6.  **Evaluate Fundamentally:** Assess combinations based on cryptographic principles, difficulty of forging biometrics/tokens, information theory constraints, speed of light/computation limits.
  7.  **Iterate:** Select (1), decompose token generation and biometric verification further...
  8.  **Finalize:** Describe the chosen solution based on secure proof-of-possession and unique biometric identifiers.

<example type="invalid">
  **Scenario:** Designing a novel user authentication system.
  **Agent does NOT apply the rule:**
  "Okay, let's brainstorm authentication. We could use passwords, maybe add MFA with an authenticator app like Google Authenticator. Or we could integrate Sign in with Google using OAuth2."
  *(Agent immediately jumps to existing solutions/frameworks without questioning assumptions or decomposing the core problem)*
